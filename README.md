Terraform Project: Cloud Infrastructure Automation

Overview:
This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of cloud infrastructure using Terraform. In a typical scenario,
you may be working in a company where you're assigned a set of tickets to resolve. This project simulates that situation, where you would 
use Terraform to manage resources in AWS, such as EC2 instances, security groups, VPCs, key pairs, and other infrastructure components.

The goal of this project is to apply Terraform best practices, automate infrastructure provisioning, and help
streamline operations.
